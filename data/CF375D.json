We will assume that the tree vertices are numbered by integers from 1 to $ n $ . Then we represent the color of vertex $ v $ as $ c_{v} $ . The tree root is a vertex with number 1.\n\nIn this problem you need to answer to $ m $ queries. Each query is described by two integers $ v_{j},k_{j} $ . The answer to query $ v_{j},k_{j} $ is the number of such colors of vertices $ x $ , that the subtree of vertex $ v_{j} $ contains at least $ k_{j} $ vertices of color $ x $ .\n\nYou can find the definition of a rooted tree by the following link: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tree\\_(graph\\_theory).","inputFormat":"The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ $ (2<=n<=10^{5};\u00a01<=m<=10^{5}) $ .
