Assume that the vessels are numbered from 1 to $ n $ , in the order from the highest to the lowest, the volume of the $ i $ -th vessel is $ a_{i} $ liters.\n\n ![](https:\/\/cdn.luogu.com.cn\/upload\/vjudge_pic\/CF371D\/f198564e53bb2ea5c99e17b823930a432879118f.png)Initially, all the vessels are empty. In some vessels water is poured. All the water that overflows from the $ i $ -th vessel goes to the $ (i+1) $ -th one. The liquid that overflows from the $ n $ -th vessel spills on the floor.\n\nYour task is to simulate pouring water into the vessels. To do this, you will need to handle two types of queries:\n\n1. Add $ x_{i} $ liters of water to the $ p_{i} $ -th vessel;\n2. Print the number of liters of water in the $ k_{i} $ -th vessel.\n\nWhen you reply to the second request you can assume that all the water poured up to this point, has already overflown between the vessels.","inputFormat":"The first line contains integer $ n $ \u2014 the number of vessels ( $ 1<=n<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ).

The vessels' capacities do not necessarily increase from the top vessels to the bottom ones (see the second sample). The third line contains integer $ m $ \u2014 the number of queries ( $ 1<=m<=2\u00b710^{5} $ ). Each of the next $ m $ lines contains the description of one query.
