You are given an array $ a $ of distinct positive integers.\n\nDefine a subarray $ a_i, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_j $ to be a friend group if and only if there exists an integer $ m \\ge 2 $ such that $ a_i \\bmod m = a_{i+1} \\bmod m = \\ldots = a_j \\bmod m $ , where $ x \\bmod y $ denotes the remainder when $ x $ is divided by $ y $ .\n\nYour friend Gregor wants to know the size of the largest friend group in $ a $ .","inputFormat":"Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \\le t \\le 2\\cdot 10^4 $ ).\n\nEach test case begins with a line containing the integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5 $ ), the size of the array $ a $ .\n\nThe next line contains $ n $ positive integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \\le a_i \\le {10}^{18} $ ), representing the contents of the array $ a $ . It is guaranteed that all the numbers in $ a $ are distinct.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases is less than $ 2\\cdot 10^5 $ .","outputFormat":"Your output should consist of $ t $ lines. Each line should consist of a single integer, the size of the largest friend group in $ a $ .","samples":[["4\n5\n1 5 2 4 6\n4\n8 2 5 10\n2\n1000 2000\n8\n465 55 3 54 234 12 45 78","3\n3\n2\n6"]],"hint":"In the first test case, the array is $ [1,5,2,4,6] $ . The largest friend group is $ [2,4,6] $ , since all those numbers are congruent to $ 0 $ modulo $ 2 $ , so $ m=2 $ .\n\nIn the second test case, the array is $ [8,2,5,10] $ . The largest friend group is $ [8,2,5] $ , since all those numbers are congruent to $ 2 $ modulo $ 3 $ , so $ m=3 $ .\n\nIn the third case, the largest friend group is $ [1000,2000] $ . There are clearly many possible values of $ m $ that work.","provider":{"uid":3,"name":"\u6d1b\u8c37","avatar":"https:\/\/cdn.luogu.com.cn\/upload\/usericon\/3.png","slogan":"","badge":null,"isAdmin":true,"isBanned":false,"color":"Purple","ccfLevel":0,"background":""},"attachments":[],"canEdit":false,"limits":{"time":[2000],"memory":[256000]},"stdCode":"","vjudge":{"origin":"CodeForces","link":"http:\/\/codeforces.com\/problemset\/problem\/1548\/B","id":"1548B"},"translation":"+ \u7ed9\u5b9a $n$ \u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a $n$ \u7684\u6570\u7ec4 $a$\uff0c\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a**\u6700\u957f**\u7684\u533a\u95f4 $\\left[l,r\\right]$\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b58\u5728 $m\\geq 2$ \u548c $k$\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709 $l\\leq i\\leq r,a_i\\equiv k\\pmod{m}$\uff08\u5373**\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u6240\u6709\u6570\u5bf9 $m$ \u53d6\u6a21\u4f59\u6570\u76f8\u7b49**\uff09\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u957f\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u533a\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a $r-l+1$\uff09\u3002\n+ **\u6709\u591a\u7ec4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e**\u3002","tags":[],"wantsTranslation":false,"totalSubmit":2811,"totalAccepted":799,"flag":5,"pid":"CF1548B","title":"Integers Have Friends","difficulty":4,"fullScore":100,"type":"CF"},"contest":null,"discussions":[{"id":727343,"title":"\u8fd9\u8001\u54e5\u771f\u7684\u6ca1\u4ea4\u9519\u9898\u89e3\u5417","forum":{"id":61680,"name":"CF1548B Integers Have Friends","slug":"CF1548B"}},{"id":694721,"title":"\u8c01\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u9519\u54ea\u91cc\u4e86","forum":{"id":61680,"name":"CF1548B Integers Have Friends","slug":"CF1548B"}},{"id":586357,"title":"\u6709\u65e0\u8001\u54e5\u7528\u4e0d\u5e26\u5220\u7684\u5c3a\u53d6\u5199\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u9898","forum":{"id":61680,"name":"CF1548B Integers Have Friends","slug":"CF1548B"}}],"bookmarked":false,"vjudgeUsername":null,"recommendations":[],"lastLanguage":0,"lastCode":"","privilegedTeams":[],"userTranslation":null},"currentTitle":"Integers Have Friends","currentTheme":null,"currentTime":1727768445}
